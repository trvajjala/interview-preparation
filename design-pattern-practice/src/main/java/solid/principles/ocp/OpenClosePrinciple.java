 * The Open-Closed Principle (OCP) states that classes should be open for extension but closed for modification. “Open to extension” means that you should
 * design your classes so that new functionality can be added as new requirements are generated. “Closed for modification” means that once you have developed a
 * class you should never modify it, except to correct bugs.
